•What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
•What does fast-forward in Git mean?
•Why should you have different branches?
•In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Answers:
a)gitignore file is a text file that contains the names of files to be ignored when committing the project in GitHub. An example of gitignore file for java projet is
*.class
*.jar
*.war
*.ear
# generated files
bin/**
gen/**
# project based files
.idea/
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws
build/
bin/

b) During a merge, git simplifies the merge by moving the pointer forward when there is no conflicts between branches. this is called as fast fowrward.

c) In a project, branches help the team members to maintain their own code isolated from the main code (source code).

d) You can have multiple repositories for a single project based on the size of the project. but we can have only one "origin" repository.
